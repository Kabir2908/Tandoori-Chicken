Chicken – I have taken chicken thighs with legs to make tandoori chicken. You can choose to use only legs or even boneless chicken cut in small cubes.

For the first marination, we will need salt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, and Kashmiri red chilli powder. The first marination makes the chicken tender and juicy when cooked.

For the second marination, we need hung curd. It is nothing but thick yogurt. You can use greek yogurt in place of it. If you have plain yogurt, you can hang it in a muslin cloth for a few hours so that a lot of liquid is discarded and then use it.

Hung curd is advised as it sticks to the chicken pieces and binds all the spices with it.

You will also need ginger garlic paste, lemon juice, and dry spices like Kashmiri red chilli powder, roasted cumin powder, garam masala powder, turmeric powder, and coriander powder.

To make authentic tandoori chicken, use mustard oil in the marination. It gives a very traditional taste to it. If mustard oil is not available, you can use any other oil.

Finally, adding some kasuri methi and fresh cream gives it a restaurant like the taste. Some people add artificial food colour in this recipe but since it’s not healthy to use them, I refrain from adding them in my recipes.
